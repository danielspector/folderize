# Folderize

Folderize is a quick and easy way to get set up with a Ruby file strucutre. To install type the following into your Terminal:

```bash
$ gem install folderize
```

Once installed and you want to create a new Ruby project, create a new directory for your project and run the following command at the root of your new project:

```bash
$ folderize
```
After a few moments, you should have a fully-scaffolded Ruby file directory to start working with.

## Notes

The generator is very beta at the moment. The project is licensed under MIT so use at your own risk. Any pull requests to add new functionality are welcome!
